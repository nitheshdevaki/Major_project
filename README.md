Indoor navigation using iot on lifi

While visiting huge business establishment like big institutions and giant hospitals 
people are generally unaware of buildings architecture, basic features and also find them 
self-lost. People visiting such establishments are baffled in amidst of throng to reach out 
for goods and services they are looking for, where the conventional GPS fails to operate. 
We are proposing an indoor navigation system which utilizes Light Fidelity technology 
to position a person accurately. This technology makes use of the existing light fixtures 
in a building and capable of guiding the user to his/her destination. Li-Fi is a wireless 
short range visible light communication which used visible light spectrum to transmit 
data. It cannot pass through opaque objects and requires line of sight. These properties 
of Li-Fi ensure that it provides accurate positional information. In a Li-Fi system led 
acts as transmitter and a light sensor acts as the receiver. The LEDs are provided with 
unique positional information which is transmitted to the receiver when it comes in the 
range of the transmitter. From the receiver this data is saved in cloud and an android 
application taps this data and represents the position of the user in a map and further 
guides to his/her destination. This system ensures a hassle-free experience for the user
